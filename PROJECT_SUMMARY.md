✅ Activity tracking for user actions  

### Frontend (Just Completed)
✅ User authentication (Login & Register pages)  
✅ Channel browsing and creation  
✅ Real-time chat interface  
✅ Socket.IO integration for live updates  
✅ User join/leave notifications  
✅ Modern, responsive UI design  
✅ Protected routes  
✅ Context-based state management

## Key Technologies Used

### Frontend
- React 19 with Hooks
- Vite (build tool)
- React Router DOM v7
- Socket.IO Client
- Axios for HTTP requests
- Context API for state management

### Backend (Existing)
- Node.js with Express
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- Socket.IO
- JWT for authentication
- Security middleware (Helmet, XSS, Rate Limiting)

## User Flow

1. **Registration/Login**
   - User creates account or logs in
   - JWT token stored in localStorage
   - User data cached for quick access

2. **Channel Selection**
   - User sees list of available channels
   - Can create new channels
   - Click to join a channel

3. **Chat Experience**
   - Join selected channel
   - View message history
   - Send messages in real-time
   - See when users join/leave
   - Messages sync across all connected clients

## Real-Time Features

### Socket Events
- **Client → Server**: `joinChannel`, `leaveChannel`, `sendMessage`
- **Server → Client**: `connected`, `user_joined`, `user_left`, `newMessage`, `error`

### Real-Time Updates
- New messages appear instantly
- Join/leave notifications
- Automatic scrolling to latest message
- Activity indicators

## API Endpoints Used

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Create new user
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Authenticate user

### Channels
- `GET /api/channels` - List all channels
- `POST /api/channels` - Create new channel
- `GET /api/channels/:id` - Get channel details

### Messages
- `GET /api/channels/:id/messages` - Get channel messages
- `POST /api/channels/:id/messages` - Send message (REST fallback)

## Security Features

- JWT token authentication
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- XSS protection on inputs
- Rate limiting on API
- Helmet security headers
- Protected routes on frontend
- Token stored securely in localStorage

## Scalability Considerations

- Indexed database queries
- Compound indexes for performance
- Pagination support in API
- Socket.IO room-based messaging
- Lean queries to reduce memory
- Async/await for non-blocking operations

## Running the Application

### Development Mode
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Production Build
```bash
# Build frontend
cd frontend
npm run build

# Serve with backend (or use nginx)
cd backend
npm start
```

## Testing Instructions

1. Start MongoDB (local or Atlas)
2. Start backend server
3. Start frontend dev server
4. Register an account
5. Create a channel
6. Open in multiple tabs to test real-time features
7. Send messages and verify instant updates

## Additional Notes

- MongoDB connection string can be configured in `.env`
- CORS is enabled for development
- Socket.IO uses rooms for efficient broadcasting
- Messages are stored with full history
- Activity feed tracks user interactions

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- [ ] Message editing/deletion
- [ ] Private messaging
- [ ] File uploads
- [ ] Emoji support
- [ ] Typing indicators
- [ ] Read receipts
- [ ] User presence status
- [ ] Message search
- [ ] Channel search and filters
- [ ] Pagination for messages
- [ ] User profile pages
- [ ] Admin roles
- [ ] Message reactions

## Conclusion

The application is fully functional and ready for use. The frontend provides a modern, intuitive interface for real-time team communication with all core features implemented. The architecture supports scalability and can be extended with additional features as needed.
